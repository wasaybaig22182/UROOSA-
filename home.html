<h1><b>Nature</b></h1>
<p>Nature is the connection between the physical world surrounding us and the life inside us. Nature is God's most precious and valuable gift to humans. It is the principal source of all essential nutrients for all living things on the planet.</p>
<p>For all of us, nature is crucial. It's the reason for the existence of life on this planet. Nature is home to many different creatures. All living organisms benefit from the natural balance maintained by Mother Nature. The study of the natural environment is a separate discipline of science. Every element has its own story to tell. Natureâ€™s beauty is portrayed through the <b>sun</b> and <b>moon</b>, the <b>plants</b>, the <b>flowers</b>, etc. It is a common belief that reacting to something is a natural human characteristic. Naturally drawn characteristics are defined as genetic traits of an organism in sociology. The resources of nature are plentiful. The proper use of resources aids in the conservation of the environment. <i> Natural scavengers include a variety of land and marine animals.</i> Nature has provided us with a variety of ways to utilise it effectively.

    With the increasing population, the threats towards nature are increasing. With the growth in population, the resources are now depleting. Excessive levels of air and environmental pollutants add to the mix. Industrial waste, unrestricted vehicle use, illicit tree cutting, wildlife hunting, nuclear power plants, and a slew of other factors are contributing to the disruption of natural systems. The extinction of species as enormous as dinosaurs and the survival of animals as tiny as ants have been documented in history. It is unavoidable to remember, among other things, that nature can play both a protective and destructive role. Natural disasters, pandemics, and natural crisis scenarios have demonstrated the need for humans to maintain the subtle balance of nature in order to ensure the continuation of life on Earth for the benefit of future generations.</p>
